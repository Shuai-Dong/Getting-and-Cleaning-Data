Getting and Cleaning Data--final project

This is the final project of Coursera Data Science class Getting and Cleaning Data.
This folder contains 
R script: project-script.r
Codebook of final data: project-codebook
final data: allData_sub_mean.txt 
read me file: README.txt

The R script perform functions
1. Download and unzip dataset containing data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone
2. Load every individual dataset into R
3. Assign names to different dataset, including using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the measurement data set
4. Combine two seperate dataset (train and test)
5. Subset data that contains only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
6. Produce independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
7. Write the resulting dataset onto local drive named "allData_sub_mean.txt" 

Codebook of final data: project-codebook
contains the details of labels of variables

final data: allData_sub_mean.txt 
the data that produced by the project-script.r script
